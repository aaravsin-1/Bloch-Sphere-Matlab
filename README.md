Bloch Sphere Visualizer in MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB code for visualising qubit states on the Bloch sphere.
It allows you to compute and plot arbitrary quantum states such as |0⟩, |1⟩, |+⟩, |-⟩, |i⟩, and superpositions

## Features

Plot a 3D Bloch sphere with transparent shading.

Show axes, basis states, and labels (|0⟩, |1⟩, |+⟩, |-⟩, |i⟩, |-i⟩).

Add equatorial great circles around X, Y, Z axes.

Compute and plot any qubit state vector (|ψ⟩) on the Bloch sphere.

Automatically display a LaTeX-formatted expression for the state on the figure.

Includes helper functions for:

Density matrices

Bloch vector extraction

State formatting in LaTeX

Requirements
MATLAB R2021a or later (tested)
No toolboxes required - pure MATLAB code
